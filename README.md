## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This app displays pictures of my choosing all with a 'like' button, which gives a user the option to like that picture. When that button is clicked, it keeps track of the number of likes and displays text saying how many likes that picture has. A user can also click the picture itself and a description of the photo will appear. A challenge of this project was to get the description to display in place of the photo when the photo was clicked, and when clicked again, the photo returns. I solved it using conditional rendering.
